# 🌟 Project Overview: MyDRTV 🌟

## 📺 Project Overview
Welcome to **MyDRTV**! This innovative project is focused on creating a cutting-edge video player and social networking platform for the state broadcaster in Denmark. Our mission? To showcase and promote Danish television and film on a global scale, making a treasure trove of classic TV programs accessible to audiences around the world! 🌍

As we explore outsourcing options to optimize development costs—particularly in Eastern Europe and Asia—we will meticulously define the solution architecture and technology stack to meet both economic and functional requirements. 💻

## 📜 Requirements
The MyDRTV platform is designed with users in mind, featuring a host of essential capabilities:

- **👤 User Accounts:** Users can create personalized accounts for a tailored experience.
- **⭐ Ratings System:** Community-driven evaluations allow users to rate programs and share their opinions.
- **🔍 Search Functionality:** A versatile search engine that enables users to find films and TV shows using various criteria, such as:
  - Year of production
  - Title
  - Genre

### ⚡ High Availability
Ensuring high availability is paramount due to the reputational risks associated with delivering a reliable and engaging user experience. Our system will integrate a widely used rating system to encourage user interaction and foster vibrant conversations about classic TV programs and films. 🗣️

### 🚀 Digital Transformation Goals
MyDRTV is a key component of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation's (DR) broader digital transformation strategy, focusing on several vital business aspects:

- **📈 Marketing DR Services:** Actively promote services to attract potential customers.
- **🤝 User Engagement:** Enhance interactivity through the ratings system and suggest similar programs to keep users engaged longer.
- **🔒 GDPR Compliance:** Uphold the highest standards of data protection, ensuring personally identifiable information is managed in strict accordance with GDPR regulations.

Our project is not just about entertainment; it’s about celebrating and preserving the cultural heritage of Denmark while adhering to global standards for user data protection. Join us on this exciting journey! 🎉
